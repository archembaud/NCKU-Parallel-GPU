# Bug Hunt 3 - OpenMP

This code is supposed to return the output:

```bash
Original value of a[0] = 0
Original value of a[1] = 1
Original value of a[2] = 2
Original value of a[3] = 3
Original value of a[4] = 4
Original value of a[5] = 5
Original value of a[6] = 6
Original value of a[7] = 7
Final value of a[0] = 0
Final value of a[1] = 0.5
Final value of a[2] = 1
Final value of a[3] = 1.5
Final value of a[4] = 2
Final value of a[5] = 2.5
Final value of a[6] = 3
Final value of a[7] = 3.5
```

Please fix it to ensure the output matches.
