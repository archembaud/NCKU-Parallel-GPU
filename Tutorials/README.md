# Bug Hunt Tutorials

These are not your typical tutorials where instructions are provided on how to perform some tasks using C, OpenMP and GPU.

These are bug hunts.

All of the codes in this folder are broken in some way. These errors might be:
* Problems with the makefiles,
* Syntax errors in the codes themselves,
* Logic errors which prevent the codes from running or producing the correct results, or
* Some other evil mistake I've come up with.

Your mission is to correct these bugs, using:

* Error messages returned on the command line,
* Google searches, and
* AI (LLMs) if you are desparate.

Most of these bug hunts have been created from the sample codes provided in this repository - so another way of fixing these bugs is by checking the sample codes.
