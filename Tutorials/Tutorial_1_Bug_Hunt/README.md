# Tutorial 1 Bug Hunt

Welcome to the level 0 bug hunt. This is the first in a series of increasingly complex bug hunts where your mission is to:

* Find the bug in the code, and
* Fix it, and finally
* Run the code and check the output.

These activities are designed to help you:
* Practice finding issues in code which are common - i.e. many of these errors are things you'll do yourself. And...
* Practice working on code that wasn't written by you. You may not like my coding style - and you don't have to. But being an engineer means working with code that you didn't write, using styles you might not agree with. And you better get used to it now.
