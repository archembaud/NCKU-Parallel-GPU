# Tutorial 7 - GPU Bug Hunt B

There is something wrong with these codes. These problems could be in:

* The makefile - this would stop the code from compiling correctly,
* A syntax error - this would also stop the code from compiling as well, OR
* A logic error - the code can run, but this might produce a segmentation fault.

Your goal is to fix this code and get it working.
